# SPERO RESTORATION - ROUTES INITIALIZATION
# ======================================================
# This file turns the 'routes' folder into a Flask module
# and helps organize all page controllers (blueprints).

from flask import Blueprint

# Base blueprint (placeholder)
routes_bp = Blueprint("routes", __name__)

# No routes defined here â€” they are imported individually
# from main_routes.py, contact_routes.py, blog_routes.py,
# sitemap_routes.py, and admin_routes.py
